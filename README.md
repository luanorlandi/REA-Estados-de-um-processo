Instructors may suggest this tool other people in the same area to also use it while introducing the content covered by the OER to their students. Thus, the tool would be released to more students. 

### Students

They can just watch their teachers using the tool, or if they want they can also access the OER through a link. This way they can use the OER by their own devices at home.

If they have any trouble in understanding the theme, the use of the resource should facilitate their knowledge in issues addressed by the OER.
